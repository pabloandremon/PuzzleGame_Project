# Proyect.01_C
## Same Proyect.01 but structured with classes.

This is a simple game in which you are challenged to complete really simple (or tricky) puzzles. The game stars with an introduction. Then comes the puzzles with it's instructions. You will only be using your mouse in this game. The main algorithm in the code is the "if"/"else" statement, that gives the user multiple tries of the puzzle if they pick/click the wrong choice or continue with next puzzle if user chose correclty. This proyect is the same as the other branches, but it is mainly structured with classes.
